# End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) Strategy

This document outlines a proposed strategy for implementing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for the custom CRM application. The goal is to ensure that sensitive client information and uploaded files are kept private, even from the server administrators.

## 1. Core Concepts

### 1.1. Client-Side Encryption

The fundamental principle of this E2EE strategy is that all sensitive data is encrypted on the client's device (the browser) before it is sent to the server. The server will only ever store encrypted data (ciphertext). The server will never have access to the decryption keys, so it cannot read the data.

### 1.2. Key Management

The security of an E2EE system relies on the secure management of cryptographic keys. We will use a combination of asymmetric (public/private key) and symmetric key cryptography.

*   **Asymmetric Cryptography (Public/Private Keys):** Used for key exchange and sharing. Each user will have a public/private key pair. The public key can be shared freely, while the private key must be kept secret.
*   **Symmetric Cryptography:** Used for encrypting the actual data. This is much faster than asymmetric cryptography and is suitable for encrypting large amounts of data or files.

## 2. Proposed Implementation Strategy

### 2.1. User Registration

1.  When a new user registers, a public/private key pair is generated in their browser.
2.  The user's password is used to derive a strong encryption key (e.g., using a key derivation function like Argon2).
3.  The user's private key is encrypted with this password-derived key.
4.  The **encrypted** private key and the **plaintext** public key are sent to the server for storage.

### 2.2. User Login

1.  When a user logs in, they provide their email and password.
2.  The server sends the user's encrypted private key to the browser.
3.  The user's password is used to derive the same encryption key as during registration.
4.  This key is used to decrypt the private key, which is then held in memory for the duration of the session. The plaintext password and the decrypted private key should never be stored persistently on the client.

### 2.3. Data Encryption (e.g., Client Information)

1.  When a user wants to save a piece of sensitive information (e.g., a client's intake form), a new random symmetric key is generated in the browser.
2.  The data is encrypted with this symmetric key.
3.  The symmetric key is then encrypted with the user's public key.
4.  The encrypted data and the encrypted symmetric key are sent to the server for storage.

### 2.4. File Encryption

1.  Before a file is uploaded, it is encrypted in the browser.
2.  A new random symmetric key is generated for the file.
3.  The file is encrypted with this symmetric key (this can be done in chunks for large files).
4.  The symmetric key is encrypted with the user's public key.
5.  The encrypted file and the encrypted symmetric key are uploaded to the server.

## 3. Recommended Libraries

For implementing the cryptographic operations, it is strongly recommended to use a well-vetted, open-source library.

*   **`libsodium-wrappers`:** A modern, easy-to-use, and highly secure library that provides all the necessary cryptographic primitives. It is a wrapper around the widely trusted `libsodium` library and can be used in both Node.js and the browser (compiled to WebAssembly and JavaScript).
*   **`end-to-end` (OpenPGP.js):** This library, developed by Google, implements the OpenPGP standard. It is a more comprehensive, but also more complex, solution. It provides a full suite of tools for key management, encryption, and digital signatures.

For this project, **`libsodium-wrappers`** is likely the better choice due to its simplicity and modern design.

## 4. Addressing Open-Source Concerns

A common concern with open-source security software is that the public availability of the source code could make it less secure. However, for a well-designed cryptographic system, the opposite is true.

*   **Security Through Transparency:** The security of this E2EE system relies on the strength of the cryptographic algorithms and the correct implementation, not on the secrecy of the code. The fact that the code is open-source allows for public scrutiny and auditing by security experts, which can help to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Server:** The server is designed to be "zero-knowledge," meaning it has no knowledge of the unencrypted data or the keys needed to decrypt it. An attacker who compromises the server would only be able to access encrypted data, which would be useless without the users' passwords.

The security of the system ultimately depends on the user keeping their password secure, as this is the key to unlocking their private key. We must also ensure that the client-side code is delivered securely to the user (e.g., via HTTPS) to prevent it from being tampered with in transit.
